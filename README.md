# Minimum Weight Triangulation code
This repository contains the implementation of our paper 
Hard in Theory, Easy in Practice: Solving Large Minimum-Weight Triangulation Instances to Provable Optimality.
For build instructions, check `INSTALL.md`.

## Experiment data
Because of the size of our instances, the instances are not in this repository.
To re-run our experiments, you first have to download the instance files;
there are two instance file bundles (due to size restrictions), one containing
the random instances (`https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15601787`) and one 
containing all the other instances (`https://zenodo.org/records/15601475`).
